This program was created using IntelliJ IDEA and compiled with JDK 10.0.1

To run this program:
1. Unzip Team9-master
2. Import the Team9-master folder as a project into an IDE
2. Use JDK 10.0.1 for the project SDK 
3. Double click on the Main class to see the source code (or setup configuration to run Main)
4. Compile and run

If there is an issue with the unit tests not compiling, install JUnit or simply exclude the tests folder from compiling. 

The code will generate a folder under /src/com/company named 'reports' which will contain sub-directories and text files for all reports that are generated.

We are unsure if older JDK versions are compatible.
